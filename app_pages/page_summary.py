        f'Powdery Mildew is a common fungus, that affects a wide array of plants,'
        f'manifesting as light grey or white powdery spots primarily on leaves but '
        f'also on stems, flowers, fruits, and vegetables. The spread of these spots '
        f'progressively covers most leaves, particularly impacting new plant growth.\n\n'


        f'While seldomly fatal, unchecked powdery mildew can inflict serious harm '
        f'by depriving plants of water and nutrients. Typical effects include '
        f'yellowing, withering, or distortion of leaves, along with weakened growth,'
        f'reduced blooming, and slower development.\n\n'


        f'Currently, manual inspection of each **cherry tree** requires approximately 30 minutes,'
        f' with an additional minute per tree for treatment application if necessary. '
        f'This process, given the multitude of trees across various farms, lacks scalability. '
        f'To address this, the IT team proposed implementing a machine learning (ML) system '
        f'for instant powdery mildew detection in **cherry tree** images, with potential '
        f'application to other crops if successful.\n\n'
